    <p class="text_column">Wasteland is a collective of artists and designers from around the Midwest. With its disruptive, graphic-led approach, the collective takes its cues from post punk, underground comics, skateboarding, and the spirit of subculture as a whole. Wasteland is not one person, nor is it one idea. It sits in the space between people.Projections would include user engagement and shifts in personal perspective. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Site development will align with the overall artist interests and challenge users to take abstract concepts (emotional state, mental illness, gender, sexuality, etc.) and allow to it be digested in digital form.The benefit of this interaction would result in the artist’s print media being sold. In order to ensure that every user has the equal accessibility to each artist’s work there will be direct contact information for the artists. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Although, this may seem to be an unnecessarily extra step for the user, it creates an inclusive and uplifting platform for individual artists to showcase their social media presence along with personal communication to each user/purchaser. This approach will minimize the capitalistic and competitive nature that exists within then creative community. Wasteland does not function as a profit orientated marketspace. </p>
